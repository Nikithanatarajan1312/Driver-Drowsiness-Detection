# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Developed a driver fatigue detection system to detect fatigue by analyzing facial expressions. The system utilizes Python, OpenCV, Dlib to map 68 facial landmarks and CNN to classify eye and mouth states from Region of Interest images. Key metrics like the frequency of mouth opening, the percentage of eyelid closure, and head positioning are considered.
